# json-exercise
A simple practice project for experimenting with JSON as part of my studies.

Part 1: JSON record & Fetch API
- Created a custom JSON file with:
    - strings
    - an image link
    - an array
    - a nested array
- Fetched the file with Fetch API
- Displayed the data on the webpage with JavaScript

Part 2: Pokémon search
- Search box where the user enters a Pokémon name
- Function poke() is called when the Search button is pressed
- Function fetches JSON data from pokeapi.co
- Retrieves Pokémon details and image
- Flip button changes the image to show the back view of the Pokémon
- Function kaannakuva() fetches the back image and replaces the previous one

Part 3: Weather data
- Displays the time when the page was loaded (using JavaScript time)
- Uses open JSON data from OpenWeather service
- Fetches Helsinki weather: temperature, wind, and weather icon
